Recover original control flow graph of obfuscated binaries

Thanks to everybody who are interested in this tool, I appreciate you very much. But from the discussion with my collegues, unfortunately I have to close it before it becomes more mature. I am very sorry about that.

The concolic execution engine I am developping based on APIs provides my collegues, and they think that this work is not stable enough. I think there is no problem about confidentiality, just it is not yet a suitable moment for the publication.

If you want to know more about this issue, there are several discussions [here](http://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/9364/reconstruct-control-flow-graph-from-x86-instruction-trace)
