Recover original control flow graph of obfuscated binaries

Thanks to everybody who are interested in this tool, I appreciate you very much. But from the discussion with my collegues, unfortunately I have to close it before it becomes more mature. I am very sorry about that.

The concolic execution engine I have written based on APIs provides my collegues, and they think that this work is not stable enough. I think there is no problem about confidentiality, just it is not yet a suitable moment for the publication.
